Pavlov VR is great, but what if your friends don't all have VR?

[h1] About [/h1]
This is currently a simple addon with the goal of bringing compatibility between GMOD's built-in TTT gamemode and Catse's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1678408548]VRMod addon[/url] through UI ports, VR weapon replacements, and other fun features.

[h1] Usage [/h1]
Make sure that you have the LATEST VRMod module files! Then make sure VR users and the server all have Catse's VRMod addon and this addon, and once you are in-game, type vrmod_start into console (It will error if you are in spectator mode!). To return to normal, type vrmod_exit in console.

[h1] Controls [/h1]
Default controller bindings are included for the following controllers:
-[url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bennyd87708/TTTVR/master/workshop/pictures/controls_vive.png]HTC Vive[/url]
-[url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bennyd87708/TTTVR/master/workshop/pictures/controls_index.png]Valve Index/Knuckles[/url]
You can view and edit the bindings using SteamVR's binding editor while in GMOD VR.
If you use a different controller and want to help me setup defaults, please add me on Steam!
